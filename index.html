                    [after the hovercraft makes a crash landing in the hanger of Serenity. Simon runs to his sister] Dr. Simon Tam: River? River Tam: I swallowed a bug. 
                Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Kaylee, what in the sphincter of hell are you playing at? We got the primary buffer panel coming right... Kaylee Frye: Everything's shiny, Cap'n. Not to fret. 
                Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: You told me those entry couplings would hold for another week! Kaylee Frye: That was six months ago, Cap'n.
                 Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: My ship don't crash. If she crashes, you crashed her. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: I got no answers for you, Inara. I got no rudder. Wind blows northerly, I go north. 
                 That's who I am. Now, maybe that ain't a man to lead, but they have to follow. So you wanna tear me down... do it inside your own mind. I'm not trying to tear you down. But you fog things up. 
                 You always have. You spin me about. I wish like hell you was elsewhere. Inara Serra: I was. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Doctor, I'm takin' your sister under my protection here. If anything happens to her, 
                 anything at all, I swear to you, I will get very choked up. Honestly, there could be tears. Mr. Universe: I cried like a baby, a hungry, angry baby. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: I know she meant to kill me 
                 'fore the Doc put her to sleep, which how exactly does that work anyhow? Dr. Simon Tam: Safeword. The people who helped me break River out - they had intel that River and the other subjects were being 
                 embedded with behavioral conditioning. They taught me a safeword, in case... something happened. Kaylee Frye: Not sure I get it. Dr. Simon Tam: A phrase that's encoded in her brain, that makes her fall asleep. 
                 If I speak the words, "Eta... Jayne Cobb: Well don't say it! Zo�: It only works on her, Jayne. Jayne Cobb: Oh... Well, now I know that. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: [to Inara] But you fog things up! You always have. 
                 You spin me about. I wish like hell you were elsewhere. Inara Serra: [sighs] I was. Kaylee Frye: [to Simon who wasn't on the mission that the captain and others just got back from] Are you ok? 
                 Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Is *he* OK? Jayne Cobb: We're gonna explode? I don't wanna explode! Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Jayne, how many weapons you plan on bringing? You only got the two arms. 
                 Jayne Cobb: I just get excitable as to choice- like to have my options open. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: I don't plan on any shooting taking place during this job. Jayne Cobb: Well, what you plan 
                 and what takes place ain't ever exactly been similar. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: No grenades. [Jayne groans] Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: No grenades! Zo�: We crashin' again? Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Go talk to your husband. Is the mule prepped?
                  Zo�: Good to go sir. Just loading her up. Are those grenades? Jayne Cobb: Cap'n doesn't want them. Zo�: We're robbing the place, we're not occupying it. Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: [shouting down into the vault] 
                  We're coming down to empty the vault now! Vault Guard: [calling back up] You'll have to give me your authorization password! [Jayne fires a burst from his automatic rifle] Vault Guard: Uh... okay!
